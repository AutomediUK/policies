# ETHICAL MARKETING POLICY
 
Automedi believes in the power of luxury and sustainability - neither one should have to contradict the other. Through its work and commitments, Automedi inspires couture fashion houses, lifestyle editors, wedding planners and design enthusiasts to create impact. In everything, Automedi does, it believes in honesty, fairness, and responsibility. 

## WHY ETHICAL MARKETING
 
Our advertising aligns with the company’s foundational beliefs of ethics and environmentalism. We are always looking for new consumers and partners, and do this ethically and sustainably. We do NOT work with or partner with any business that promotes individual, societal or environmental exploitation or harm. Our ethical marketing policy applies to legal compliance, trust building, environmental sustainability, diversity and safeguarding children. The company’s marketing team ensures activities comply with this policy, with ultimate accountability resting with the Chief Marketing Director.  
 
 
# AUTOMEDI’S COMMITMENT TO HONEST & TRANSPARENT MARKETING  

Automedi does not use untruthful or deceptive representation in its campaigns or partner-driven projects that could confuse or mislead audiences. This includes:    
·      False advertising - incorrect product or service details, including features, benefits and limitations.   
·      Clickbait - misleading copy or shocking imagery used to grab attention and incite fear or distress for no justifiable reason.  
·      Fake or doctored reviews and testimonials.  
·      Distorted metrics when creating messaging for Automedi campaigns or its potential partners.  
·      False or misleading comparison to its competitors.   
·      Complicated pricing strategies for products or services.  
 
All Automedi marketing and communications are prepared earnestly, with a deep-rooted responsibility to always provide its audiences, clients, and partners with lawful, decent, and truthful information.  
  
  
# Transparent Advertising Is a Priority 
 
Automedi and its respective teams ask themselves the following questions during campaign strategy, creation, and implementation:  
·      Is the campaign communicating Automedi's product or service accurately without misleading audiences? 
·      Is correct language being used that honestly outlines Automedi products or services? 
·      Is the copy for our advertisements, emails, and social media posts respectful?  
·      Have customers, partners, and employees been quoted accurately when sharing reviews or testimonials? 
·      Are the data examples that promote Automedi features, benefits, or the impact of products and services honest and accurate? Has anyone chosen to exclude anything they should not?  
·      Is there internal pressure to communicate false information about the company, its operations, or its projects? If so, notify both the company’s founders and Chief Marketing Officer. 
 
# OUR COMMITMENT TO REJECTING IMPACT AND GREENWASHING   
  
## WE PLEDGE NOT TO:  
 
·      Use environmental claims that aren’t backed up by evidence.  
·      Cherry-pick data for the company’s benefit or focus on stories that don’t represent the whole picture.  
·      Share stories about or promote partnerships that create social or environmental impact without actively being involved or being able to demonstrate that impact. 
·      Communicate false promises or make unrealistic claims.  
·      Create impact initiatives that don’t align with the eco-conscious values of Automedi.   
 
# OUR COMMITMENT TO CULTURAL SENSITIVITY IN CAMPAIGN CREATIVE  
 
Automedi and its partners prioritise diversity and inclusion. The company promotes ongoing internal training to increase cultural awareness while engaging in target audience research to seek feedback on planned campaigns' appropriateness and sensitivity. 
  
## WE PLEDGE NOT TO:  
 
·      Appropriate, stereotype, exploit or underrepresent people or groups 
·      Partner with people without lived experience of the topics raised in Automedi campaigns.    
·      Promote products or services to vulnerable or susceptible populations, such as minors or individuals with addiction or mental health issues.   
·      Never take sides in political or controversial issues likely to cause offence or harm.  
·      Engage in the ‘saviour complex’ - targeting a perceived need for support without engaging with and empowering the affected community.

# OUR COMMITMENT TO ETHICAL DIGITAL ADVERTISING 
 
Digital advertising brings an ever-disputed and ever-evolving set of ethical issues related to data privacy. Popular marketing platforms, including Meta and Google, use advanced tracking technologies to understand, profile, track, and target users online so that advertisers can effectively reach their target audience to sell products or services. This detailed targeting often comes at the cost of individual users' privacy. As consumers become more aware and attitudes and technologies shift, the ethical considerations surrounding digital advertising are rapidly evolving. The line between legal and ethically acceptable is anticipated to move many times over the short and long term. Automedi and its digital marketing partners are committed to staying up-to-date with regulatory changes, ensuring its practices uphold the industry's highest standards, are lawful, and align with the company's foundational beliefs.    
  
# OUR APPROACH TO ETHICAL ADVERTISING INCLUDES:  
 
·      Compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.  
·      Automedi doesn’t engage in advertising practices that utilise consumers' personal information without consent. 
·      Consumer data is vigilantly protected from unauthorised access and misuse. It will never under any circumstances be sold for commercial re-use. 
·      Transparent advertorial advertising – all paid partnerships are visible, clear, and honest, ensuring social users understand that though the content may appear editorial, it is paid for.  
·      Automedi doesn’t use pop-ups or pop-under ads that create new tabs or windows behind the main browser window.  
·      Considering accessibility for users with visual or hearing impairments. 
·      Timely support and assistance for Automedi consumers, ensuring customer satisfaction with products or services.   
 
 
# OUR COMMITMENT TO ETHICAL SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION, AKA “WHITE HAT SEO” 
 
Automedi and its partners are dedicated to managing its online resources mindfully.  
## WE PLEDGE TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING:  
·      Creating an optimal user experience on its website that is easy to navigate, adds value, and performs well with sufficient loading times.

·      Ethical use of redirects to help users find the content they are looking for.

## BLACK HAT SEO: TACTICS WE AVOIDS AND DISCOURAGE:   
 
·      Using bots or software to build links automatically.  
·      Deceptive link insertion – hiding links from users so only the search engine can see them.   
·      AI-created, stolen or plagiarised content  
·      Keyword stuffing/over-optimisation – as the line shifts as the algorithm evolves, Automedi is committed to staying updated and at the forefront of ethically acceptable SEO practices.  
·       Misdirectioning through unethical redirects or pop-ups.
